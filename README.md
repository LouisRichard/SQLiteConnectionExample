# SQLiteConnectionExample

A example of SQLite connection in C#. 

This is a really hacked together example of a SQLite connection in .NET Framework.  
It works, don't get me wrong and some of the code might even be decent but it's not the best way to go about it especially considering how forgiving C# can be with coding practices.
